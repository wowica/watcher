# Watcher

A Dashboard for monitoring cardano addresses.

## Running

* Install compiler dependencies with `asdf install`
* Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies.
* See `.env.sample` as reference for required ENVs.
* Start the app with `iex -S mix`


For the time being, it simply logs when a given address receives any ADA.
